# Mkdocs Bulma Theme

Use this theme with Mkdocs.

## How to use

Add to the file named `mkdocs.yml` in your project root folder the following content:

```yaml
theme:
    name: mkdocs-bulma-theme
```

If you want to apply bulma classes to the HTML from Markdown, apply the [Bulma Classes](https://github.com/daniele-tentoni/mkdocs-bulma-classes-plugin) plugin from the same author too:

```yaml
plugins:
    - bulma-classes
```

For more info about Mkdocs go to the [official site](https://www.mkdocs.org/), for more info about theming, go to the dedicated [documentation page](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/choosing-your-theme/).

Mkdocs Bulma Theme is in an early developing stage.
